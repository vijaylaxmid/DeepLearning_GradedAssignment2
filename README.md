# Do advanced keras based NN models and autodiff based NN model

### Do keras models for four problems (4 different data sets) and Do write autodiff python  library (we discussed in class)  and based on it , do  mnist classifier in colab

1.  boolean cross entropy

2.  sparse categorical crossentropy (softmax) - try to get images of 7 classes with images.google.com google search and classify 

3.  logistic regression

4. multi head classification (multi class classification)
